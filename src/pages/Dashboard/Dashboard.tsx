// MAIN PRIORITIES:
// 1. Only display member_only pop-up events in dashboard (if they don't have a non-member price, its member-only!)
// 2. fix UI of event detail page
// 3. Change header Sign in UI + functionality to end session for signing out

// CURRENt ISSUES:
// if logged in as member -> all events are clickable, but some of the cards are still overlaid
// if not logged in as non-member -> all events are not clickable, but some of the cards are overlaid (which is what we want)

// member + non-member price available = CLICKABLE
// member + !non-member price = CLICKABLE
// non member + non-member price available = CLICKABLE
// non member + !non-member price = NOT CLICKABLE

// logged in as member -> can only see the member price
// logged in as non-member -> can see both member and non-member price
